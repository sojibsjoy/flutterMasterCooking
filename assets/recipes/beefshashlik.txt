Ingredients for Beef Kebabs (Shashlik)
2 lbs good quality beef (I used top sirloin), cut into 1 1/2″ pieces
2 Bell peppers, any color, sliced into 1 1/2″ wide pieces
1 large Purple Onion, sliced into 1 1/2″ wide pieces
15 medium bamboo or wood skewers

Ingredients for Beef Kebabs Marinade:
1 cup mild olive oil
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 medium lemons)
1 tsp salt (we love fine sea salt)
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
4 garlic cloves, pressed
3 Tbsp fresh or frozen dill, chopped (or 1 Tbsp dry dill weed)
2 dry bay leaves

1. Combine all of your marinade ingredients in a large glass or plastic bowl (do not use aluminum) and stir to combine.
2. Slice meat and transfer it into the marinade bowl, stirring well to coat. Marinate beef in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours, stirring a few times while marinating to make sure meat is evenly marinated.
Sometimes after long periods of refrigeration, the oil in the marinade can firm up a bit; it will liquify again if you let the marinated meat sit at room temp 30 minutes before skewering.
3. Soak bamboo or wooden skewers at last 30 min before skewering. After the meat is done marinating, slice veggies and skewer them with meat onto Bamboo skewers. Brush/ pour remaining marinade over skewers.
4. Grill steak kabobs over med/high heat for about 8-10 minutes or until you’ve reached the desired doneness, rotating every 2-3 minutes for even grilling. Remove kebobs from grill and let them rest at least 5 minutes before eating. If you cut into them right away, they will juice out and end up dry.
