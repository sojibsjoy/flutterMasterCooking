INGREDIENTS
▢2lb /1 kg chicken thigh fillets , skinless and boneless 
MARINADE
▢1 large garlic clove , minced (or 2 small cloves)
▢1 tbsp ground coriander
▢1 tbsp ground cumin
▢1 tbsp ground cardamon
▢1 tsp ground cayenne pepper (reduce to 1/2 tsp to make it not spicy)
▢2 tsp smoked paprika
▢2 tsp salt
▢Black pepper
▢2 tbsp lemon juice
▢3 tbsp olive oil
YOGHURT SAUCE
▢1 cup Greek yoghurt
▢1 clove garlic , crushed
▢1 tsp cumin
▢Squeeze of lemon juice
▢Salt and pepper
▢6 flatbreads (Lebanese or pita bread orhomemade soft flatbreads)
INSTRUCTIONS
Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag (or bowl).
Add the chicken and use your hands to make sure each piece is coated. If using a ziplock bag, I find it convenient to close the bag then massage the bag to disperse the rub all over each chicken piece.
Marinate overnight or up to 24 hours.
Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. Cover and put in the fridge until required (it will last for 3 days in the fridge).
Heat grill/BBQ (or large heavy based pan on stove) on medium high. You should not need to oil it because the marinade has oil in it and also thigh fillets have fat. But if you are worried then oil your hotplate/grill. (See notes for baking)
Place chicken on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely charred, then turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time).
Remove chicken from the grill and cover loosely with foil. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
