How to make Masala Chai?
Start with gathering the basic ingredients and the spices you want to add to your chai.
Heat up about 1 1/3 cup of water in a pot on medium-high heat. (This is for 2 cups of chai)
While water is heating, crush spices using a mortar and pestle or a coffee/spice grinder. Add the crushed spices to the water.
Grate the ginger directly into the pot of water.
Reduce heat to medium and bring the water to a boil.
Now add the tea leaves and let it boil for a minute. You can also add sugar at this time or add it in the cup when serving.
Add 3/4 cup of milk and stir it in.
Bring the tea to a boil. The tea can overflow easily, so keep a close eye.
Once the tea comes to a boil. Turn off the gas and cover with a lid for one minute.
Strain the tea in a cup and enjoy!
