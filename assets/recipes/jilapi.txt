Instructions
For the jilapi batter:
Mix the flour and basan together.
Mix the flour mixture and yellow food colour with 2/3 cup of water to make a thick batter, making sure no lumps remain.
Keep aside for 20 minutes.
For the sugar syrup:
In a pan dissolve the sugar with 1/2 cup of water and simmer for 5 minutes till the syrup is of 2 string consistency.
Add lemon juice and mix.
Remove from the heat and keep aside.
Making Jilapi:

Heat the oil/ghee in a broad fry pan.
The oil should be approximately 1 inch deep.
Fill the jilapi batter into a piping bag with a small hole in the center or sauce bottle which is finished with button-hole stitch.
Pipe the batter in circles and cross the circle to ensure that the spiral stays together.
Pipe around 4-5 jilapis at a time.
Turn the jilapis when firm.
Cook on a low flame till the bubbles die out.
Fry to a light golden brown.
Remove the jilapis in to a warm syrup and allow the jilapis to soak the syrup (approx.. 3-4 minutes).
Drain immediately and serve hot.
