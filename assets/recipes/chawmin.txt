Ingredients
?200g /6 oz chicken breast or thigh fillets , thinly sliced (Note 1 tenderise option)
?4 cups green cabbage , finely shredded (Note 3)
?1 1/2 tbsp peanut oil (or other cooking oil)
?2 cloves garlic , finely chopped
?200g /6 oz chow mein noodles (Note 2)
?1 carrot , julienned
?1 1/2 cups bean sprouts
?3 green onions , cut into 5cm/2" pieces
?1/4 cup (65 ml) water

Instructions
SAUCE:
Mix together cornflour and soy sauce, then mix in remaining ingredients. 
Alternative: Use 1/3 cup Chinese All Purpose Stir Fry Sauce, if you have some in stock.
CHICKEN & NOODLES
Marinate Chicken: Pour 1 tbsp of Sauce over the chicken, mix to coat, set aside to marinate for 10 minutes.
Noodles: Prepare the noodles according to the packet instructions (my pack says soak in boiled water for 1 minute), then drain.
COOKING:
Heat oil in wok or large fry pan over high heat.
Add garlic and stir fry for 10 seconds or until it starts to turn golden - don't let it burn!
Add chicken and stir fry until the surface gets a tinge of browning but inside is still raw - about 1 minute. 
Add the cabbage, carrot, and the white pieces of shallots (i.e. from the base of the stalk). Stir fry for 1 1/2 minutes until the cabbage is mostly wilted.
Add the noodles, Sauce and water*. Stir fry for 1 minute, tossing constantly. 
Add bean sprouts and remaining shallots/scallions. Toss through for 30 seconds or until the bean sprouts just start to wilt.
Remove from heat and serve immediately.
